# Privacy Policy for Quick Tab Switcher

_Last updated: May 14, 2025_

Thank you for using **Quick Tab Switcher**. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how your data is handled by the Quick Tab Switcher browser extension.

## 1. Overview

Quick Tab Switcher is a lightweight and privacy-respecting browser extension that allows users to quickly switch between open tabs using a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Space). When triggered, a popup appears enabling users to search and navigate through all currently open tabs.

## 2. No Data Collection

We want to be absolutely clear:

- ✅ **We do not collect or store any personal data.**  
- ✅ **We do not transmit any data to any servers, third-party services, or analytics providers.**  
- ✅ **All functionality happens locally in your browser.**

Quick Tab Switcher runs entirely on your device and does not track, record, or share any information about your browsing activity.

## 3. Permissions

To function properly, the extension requests the following browser permissions:

- `tabs`: This is required to access and display the list of currently open tabs so that you can search and switch between them.

These permissions are used **solely** for the core functionality of the extension. They are not used to collect or transmit any data.

## 4. Open Source Transparency

Quick Tab Switcher is an open-source project. You can view the complete source code on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Vishesh-Pandey/qt-switcher). We encourage you to inspect the code and verify that your privacy is respected.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. If any changes are made, the updated version will always be available in the `PRIVACY.md` file of the public repository.

## 6. Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository or contact the maintainer directly.

**Your privacy matters. Quick Tab Switcher is built with the principle that what happens in your browser, stays in your browser.**
